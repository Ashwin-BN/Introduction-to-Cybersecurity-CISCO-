# social engineering attacks:
----------------------------
1.Pretexting: This is when an attacker calls an individual and lies to them in an attempt to gain access to privileged data.
For example, pretending to need a personâ€™s personal or financial data in order to confirm their identity.

2.Tailgating: This is when an attacker quickly follows an authorized person into a secure, physical location.

3.Something for something (quid pro quo): This is when an attacker requests personal information from a person in exchange for something, like a free gift.


# Denial-of-Service:
-------------------
Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks are a type of network attack that is relatively simple to carry out, even by an unskilled attacker. A DoS attack results in some sort of interruption of network service to users, devices or applications.


# Distributed DoS:
-----------------
A Distributed DoS (DDoS) attack is similar to a DoS attack but originates from multiple, coordinated sources. For example:

An attacker builds a network (botnet) of infected hosts called zombies, which are controlled by handler systems.
The zombie computers will constantly scan and infect more hosts, creating more and more zombies.
When ready, the hacker will instruct the handler systems to make the botnet of zombies carry out a DDoS attack.


# Botnet:
--------
A bot computer is typically infected by visiting an unsafe website or opening an infected email attachment or infected media file. A botnet is a group of bots, connected through the Internet, that can be controlled by a malicious individual or group. It can have tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of bots that are typically controlled through a command and control server.

These bots can be activated to distribute malware, launch DDoS attacks, distribute spam email, or execute brute-force password attacks. Cybercriminals will often rent out botnets to third parties for nefarious purposes.

Many organizations. like Cisco, force network activities through botnet traffic filters to identify any botnet locations.


# On-Path Attacks
-----------------
On-path attackers intercept or modify communications between two devices, such as a web browser and a web server, either to collect information from or to impersonate one of the devices.

This type of attack is also referred to as a man-in-the-middle or man-in-the-mobile attack.

1. MitM: Happens when a cybercriminal takes control of a device without the users knowledge
