# Two Factor Authentication
---------------------------
- Implemented by popular online services like Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Apple, and Microsoft for enhanced account security.
- Requires a second token, in addition to username/password or PIN, to verify identity.
- Second token can be:

  - Biometric scan (e.g., fingerprint, facial or voice recognition).
  - Verification code sent via SMS or email.


# Open Authorization (OAuth)
----------------------------
- Instead of sharing your password with third-party applications, OAuth allows you to use your credentials from platforms like LinkedIn, Google, Facebook, or GitHub.
- This simplifies the login process and enhances security by reducing the need to expose your password to multiple services.
- Users can seamlessly access third-party applications without the hassle of managing separate login credentials, promoting ease of use and convenience.
